## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Environment Setup
```bash
# Create .env file
cp env.template .env

# Edit .env and add your OpenAI API key
nano .env
```

### Step 2: Build Docker Image
```bash
docker-compose build
```

### Step 3: Start Services
```bash
# Run in foreground (for testing)
docker-compose up

# OR run in background (for production)
docker-compose up -d
```

### Step 4: Verify Deployment
```bash
# Check service health
curl http://localhost:8000/

# Run automated tests
python test_api.py

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f
```

### Step 5: Access the Application
- Swagger UI: http://localhost:8000/docs
- ReDoc: http://localhost:8000/redoc
- Health Check: http://localhost:8000/

## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Endpoint Testing
- [ ] GET `/` - Health check returns status and endpoints
- [ ] POST `/transcribe` - Returns transcript with timestamps
- [ ] POST `/summarise` - Returns 5 topics and conversational cues
- [ ] POST `/match` - Returns compatibility score and interpretation

### Expected Behaviors
- [ ] Audio files under 25MB are accepted
- [ ] Word-level timestamps are included in transcription
- [ ] Topics have relevance scores
- [ ] Conversational cues include enthusiasm, agreement, speaking time
- [ ] Compatibility score is between 0.0 and 1.0
- [ ] Interpretation text is meaningful and detailed
- [ ] User vectors include topic and personality components
- [ ] Detailed analysis shows trait differences

### Error Handling
- [ ] Invalid API key returns clear error message
- [ ] Files over 25MB are rejected with 413 error
- [ ] Missing audio file returns 400 error
- [ ] Temporary files are cleaned up after processing

## üìä Performance Metrics

### Expected Processing Times (2-minute audio)
- Transcription: 10-30 seconds
- Summarization: 15-40 seconds
- Full matching: 20-50 seconds

### Resource Usage
- Memory: ~500MB per container
- CPU: Variable (depends on API response times)
- Disk: ~200MB for image + temporary upload files

## üîí Security Checklist

- [x] API key stored in environment variables (not hardcoded)
- [x] `.env` file in `.gitignore`
- [x] Temporary files auto-deleted after processing
- [x] File size limits enforced (25MB)
- [x] Input validation on all endpoints
- [x] No sensitive data in logs
